Marketing Team  

  As part of the marketing team I want to see what products customers are most interested in.  
  I want to focus only on those products which generate the most interest.  



  Development Team  

  As a developer I want to be able to keep track of user input or votes and store that information for later analysis.  
  As a developer I want to make sure the user has different choices from the previous iteration.  
  As a developer I want to hide voting results until user has voted a number of times so to reduce influence in their choices.  
  As a developer I want to limit each iteration of a vote to only 3 items so user isn't overwhelmed with choices.
